# Power_BI-Project Description

I have created a #dashboard on Power BI Consumer Superstore Sells Analysis Dashboard. The dataset contains historical data for product sells across different region. T
he project utilizes Power BI Desktop to create an engaging and informative analysis of Superstore market. The data set includes sales by segment, market, shipping mode 
which gives very meaningful insights such as top profitable products, loss products, top customer etc.
I have also used a map visual through which we can easily filter out data by region.
